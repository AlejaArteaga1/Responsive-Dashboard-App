## Responsive Design Implementation
### Breakpoint Strategy
The breakpoint strategy follows mobile-first design principles with carefully selected thresholds based on common device screen sizes. These breakpoints ensure optimal layout across the diverse mobile device ecosystem.
**Breakpoints Defined:**
- Small phones: < 350px width - 1 column layout
- Medium phones: 350-400px - 2 column layout
- Large phones: 400-500px - 2 column layout
- Tablets: 500-768px - 3 column layout
- Large tablets: > 768px - 4 column layout
**Design Decisions:**
These breakpoints were chosen based on statistical analysis of common device resolutions. Small phones target devices like iPhone SE, medium phones cover standard Android devices, large phones accommodate phablets, and tablet breakpoints align with iPad Mini and standard iPad dimensions. This approach ensures content remains readable and properly structured across all device categories.
### Grid System Implementation
The responsive grid system dynamically adjusts column counts based on device type and orientation, providing optimal content density for each screen size.
**Column Calculation Logic:**
The getGridColumns() function analyzes screen width against defined breakpoints and returns appropriate column counts:

-Small devices: Single column for focused content consumption

-Medium/Large phones: Two columns for balanced information density

-Tablets: Three columns to utilize additional screen space

-Large tablets: Four columns for maximum content visibility
**Orientation Handling:**
Orientation changes trigger the updateScreenData() function which recalculates screen dimensions and propagates changes through the component tree. The listenForOrientationChange() method ensures real-time layout updates.
### Typography Scaling
The typography system uses proportional scaling to maintain readability across different screen densities.
**Scaling Formula:**
The rf() function calculates: size * (screenWidth / 320) with platform-specific adjustments (-2px on Android)
**Typography Scale:**
- h1: 28pt
- h2: 24pt
- h3: 20pt
- body: 16pt
- caption: 14pt
### Spacing System
The spacing system uses percentage-based calculations for consistent visual rhythm across devices.
**Spacing Values:**
- xs: 1% of screen width
- sm: 2% of screen width
- md: 4% of screen width
- lg: 6% of screen width
- xl: 8% of screen width
## Platform-Specific Implementations
### iOS Specific Styling
-Shadow implementation using shadowColor, shadowOffset, shadowOpacity, shadowRadius

-Rounded corners with subtle border radius (8-12px)

-Status bar height adjustments for notch devices

-Native iOS navigation patterns and interaction feedback
### Android Specific Styling
-Elevation-based shadows for Material Design compliance

-Material Design color scheme and typography scales

-Status bar translucent handling for immersive experience

-Ripple effect patterns for touch interactions

## Component Architecture
### Widget System Design
The BaseWidget component serves as a foundational pattern providing consistent styling, layout structure, and interaction patterns. It enables rapid widget development through props-based customization while maintaining design system consistency.

-Avoided inline styles to prevent object recreation

-Pre-calculated style objects for variant states

-Minimal style duplication through theme system
### Render Optimization
[Document re-render prevention strategies]
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Proper key props on mapped components
- Conditional rendering optimization
- [Other techniques used]
### Performance Measurements
[Include actual FPS measurements]
- Scrolling: [X] FPS
- Orientation change: [X] FPS
- Widget interaction: [X] FPS
- Pull-to-refresh: [X] FPS
